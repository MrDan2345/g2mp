this sample demonstrates the basic process of working with the engine such as initialization, and gaining access to various pipelines of the engine.

the general life of g2mp application consists of four major parts:
Initialization - this is where the application begins and where you can arrange all the initial settings and resources.
Finalization - this is where the application ends and where you free all the resources.
Render - this is where all the render calls happen. note that g2mp does not use immediate rendering, instead all the calls are buffered, batched where possible, and then rendered in a separate internal piplene which can optionally run in a separate thread.
Update - this is where all the game logic happens, this section is frame rate independent and is executed a set (g2.Params.TargetUPS) number of times per second.
