    Amiga units for fpc.

    There should not be any problems to use
    this units in Amiga or in linux.

    For the ms-dos cross-compiler you have to
    do some changes.

    First you have to rename the units to 8.3
    e.g intuition.pas to intuitio.pas
    No need to change in the units the compiler
    will find the units anyway.

    There are a few you will have problems with,
    expansion.pas and expansionbase.pas. What
    you can do is to rename them to expan.pas
    and expanbas.pas. If a unit uses the old
    name the compiler will complain so just
    fix that unit when the problems pops up.

    The same problem with configregs.pas and
    configvars.pas, perhaps do cfgvars.pas and
    cfgregs.pas

    If you find any bugs or errors in the units
    please inform me. Address bellow.

    If you want do translate other libraries to
    fpc use Fd2Pragma, it's on Aminet. Read the
    docs for Fd2Pragma on how to make units
    for fpc. Fd2Pragma translates almost everything
    correct for fpc. There is one thing you have to
    do to the new unit, make a search/replace for
    Cardinal/ULONG. Fpc for Amiga don't handle
    Cardinals in this version (later), so we have
    to use ULONG instead. ULONG is typedefed as
    Longint (in Exec) in a new version of fpc
    we just have to typedef ULONG as Cardinal.
    What's left is for you to translate structs
    and defines.:)

    There are also two rexx scripts that can be
    handy, getrecord.rexx and make.rexx. You can
    use getrecord.rexx to check that you have
    translated the structs correct. Read more
    in the scripts headers.


    Other than that just have fun!
