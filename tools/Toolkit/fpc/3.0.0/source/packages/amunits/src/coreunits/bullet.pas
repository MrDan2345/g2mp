{ !  OT_GlyphWidth specifies a specific width for a glyph.

 *    changes the typeface to an undefined value, providing the List
 *    completes the typeface selection to the new typeface.  OTagPath
 *    is the null terminated full file path of the .otag file associated
 *    with the typeface.  OTagList is a memory copy of the processed

{  ? OT_...KernPair supplies the kern adjustment to be added to the

 *    for rendering body text.  Display kern pairs are generally
 *    tighter values for display (e.g. headline) purposes.  The
 *    adjustment is represented as a fixed binary fraction of the

 *    does when SetSoftStyle() is used), and then Solid underlining if
 *    the engine returns an error.  If the engine returns an error for
