This is the README file for the sndfile package.

The sndfile unit contains a straight translation of the sndfile library
header file (version 0.27). It should work exactly as the C header, so for any
API documentation, see the library's documentation.

To work with this unit, you need the sndfile library installed on your
system. (http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/)

The sfplay program is a rewrite in Pascal of the sfplay.c example that
comes with the sndfile lib documentation. It accepts a list of filenames
on the command-line, and will attempt to play each of the files on the sound
card - provided the sound card is correctly configured.

The testc.c file was used to find out the meaning of some hideous kernel
sound IOCTL macros. Its output was pasted into the program as constants.

Enjoy!

Michael.
