The demo directories demonstrate the use of the TFPWebDataProvider
components, using ExtJS. It demonstrates the use of JSON and XML
communication between an ExtJS Datastore and the webdataprovider.

ExtJS must be installed, it can be downloaded for free from
http://www.extjs.com/

The examples assume that it is reachable through /ext/

Demo1 shows how to use the component with a plain webdatamodule,
using actions, and creating all components on the fly.

Demo2 shows how to use the components by dropping them on a plain
webdatamodule, and handling all in the OnRequest handler of the
webdatamodule.

Demo3 shows how to use the components in combination with a
WebProviderDatamodule.

Demo4 shows how webdataprovider components can be dropped
on plain datamodules, and how these modules can be made
available to the webdatamodule.

Demo5 shows how to register your own TWebdataProvider instances, which
are created on the fly to perform their action.

Demo6 demonstrates the use of the TSQLDBWebDataProvider component.

All demos except Demo6 use CGI and a TDBF component to feed data to 
the webpage, which means they are not very suitable for real life 
situations due to file locking etc.


To try a demo, compile one of the appropriate CGI apps, and open 
the extgrid-json.html or extgrid-xml.html page in your browser 
through the webserver, something like:

http://localhost/~myuser/extjs/demo2/extgrid-json.html
