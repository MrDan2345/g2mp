For new users,

The install_objp.sh script will download the latest FPC compiler, compile, install headers into /Developer/ObjectivePascal and run the iPhone parser in one step. For the iPhone headers make sure you download the latest (Intel only) SDK from Apple's web site.

1) cd to the directory containing install_objp.sh script.
2) ./install_objp.sh
