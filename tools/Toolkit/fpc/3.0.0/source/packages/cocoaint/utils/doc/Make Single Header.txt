The parser can parse single files at a time but must first parse the entire framework in order to merge all relevant information.

1) cd to the directory which contains parser.php
2) php parser.php -root="/Developer/ObjectivePascal" -objp -all -frameworks="foundation" -only="NSObject.h" 
	
	Note: -root is the path to the directory which contains the base appkit and foundation folders. These folders come in the FPC distribution with some hand parsed headers and the master include units for each framework.
	
	-frameworks are the frameworks which the headers belong to.

You can also do a quick parse of a single header for testing purposes or acquiring other information by using the command below.

	php parser.php -root="/Developer/ObjectivePascal" -objp -header="appkit/NSApplication.h"
