 *  ATSUDirectGetLayoutDataArrayPtrFromLineRef()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Deprecated:

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Returns the data pointer specified by iDataSelector and
 *    referenced by iLineRef.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function simply returns the data pointer specified by
 *    iDataSelector and referenced by iLineRef. This data pointer
 *    should not be freed directly after it's been used. Rather, it
 *    should be released using ATSUDirectReleaseLayoutDataArrayPtr.
 *    Doing so serves as a signal to ATSUI that the caller is done with
 *    the data and that it can merge it in smoothly and adjust its
 *    internal processes. Furthermore, it may be the case that the
 *    pointer returned may be dynamically allocated one or contain
 *    dynamically allocated data. If it's not properly freed, a memory
 *    leak may result. This function may only be called within the
 *    context of an ATSUDirectLayoutOperationOverrideUPP callback. The
 *    pointer returned points to the exact data referenced by the
 *    ATSUTextLayout object that triggered the callback call. This is
 *    by far the most efficient way to use the direct access calls
 *    because for most requested data, no allocation and copy is done.
 *    Furthermore, because this a direct pointer to the data that ATSUI
 *    will use for it's layout, the data arrays returned by this can be
 *    tweaked and edited. Many of the requested arrays are created by
 *    ATSUI only when necessary. If these arrays are to be altered,
 *    then be sure to set iCreate to true. This will ensure that this
 *    array is created. If the arrays are not created, ATSUI
 *    automatically assumes that all entries in the array are zero. The
 *    pointer returned by this function is only valid within the
 *    context of the callback. Do not attempt to retain it for later
 *    use.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iLineRef:
 *      The ATSULineRef which was passed into a
 *      ATSUDirectLayoutOperationOverrideUPP callback function as a
 *      parameter.
 *    
 *    iDataSelector:
 *      The selector for the data that is being requested.
 *    
 *    iCreate:
 *      If the ATSULineRef passed in iLineRef does not reference the
 *      requested array, then a zero-filled one will be created and
 *      returned in oLayoutDataArray if this is set to true. For some
 *      ATSUDirectDataSelectors, these cannot be simply created. Thus,
 *      this flag will have no affect on these few
 *      ATSUDirectDataSelectors.
 *    
 *    oLayoutDataArrayPtr:
 *      Upon sucessful return, this parameter will contain a pointer to
 *      an array of the requested values if the ATSULineRef passed in
 *      iLineRef references those values. If this is not the case, then
 *      NULL will be returned, unless iCreate is set to true and the
 *      array can be created. This parameter itself may be set to NULL
 *      if only a count of the entries is needed.
 *    
 *    oLayoutDataCount:
 *      Upon sucessful return, this parameter will contain a count of
 *      the entries in the array returned in oLayoutDataArray.

 *  ATSUDirectGetLayoutDataArrayPtrFromTextLayout()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Deprecated:

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Returns the data pointer specified by iDataSelector and

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function simply returns the data pointer specified by
 *    iDataSelector and referenced by iTextLayout for the line starting
 *    at iLineOffset. This data pointer should not be freed directly
 *    after it's been used. Rather, it should be released using
 *    ATSUDirectReleaseLayoutDataArrayPtr. Doing so serves as a signal
 *    to ATSUI that the caller is done with the data. Furthermore, it
 *    may be the case that the pointer returned may be dynamically
 *    allocated one or contain dynamically allocated data. If it's not
 *    properly freed, a memory leak may result. This function may not
 *    be called inside the context of an
 *    ATSUDirectLayoutOperationOverrideUPP callback for the
 *    ATSUTextLayout data that triggered the callback.  All data
 *    returned will be a copy of the data in the object requested. This
 *    means two things: first of all, this means that it's a very
 *    inefficient way of using the data. All of the selectors that
 *    would have returned in constant time now would be forced to
 *    return in order-n time. Second of all, this means that the
 *    developer cannot change any of the data. Any changes the
 *    developer makes to the arrays returned by this API will have no
 *    effect on the layout. Using the 
 *    kATSULayoutOperationPostLayoutAdjustment operation selector
 *    override and the ATSUDirectGetLayoutDataArrayPtrFromLineRef is a
 *    great alternative to using this API. Many of the requested arrays
 *    are created by ATSUI only when necessary. This means that it's
 *    possible that this API will return NULL pointer and a count of 0.
 *    In this case, if there's no error returned, the array simply
 *    doesn't exist and the caller should treat all of the entries in
 *    the array that they would have recieved as being 0.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The ATSUTextLayout object from which the requested data will
 *      come from.
 *    
 *    iLineOffset:
 *      The edge offset that corresponds to the beginning of the range
 *      of text of the line of the requested data. If the text has
 *      multiple lines, then ATSUDirectGetLayoutDataArrayPtrFromLineRef
 *      will need to be called for each of the lines in which the
 *      requested data is needed.
 *    
 *    iDataSelector:
 *      The selector for the data that is being requested.
 *    
 *    oLayoutDataArrayPtr:
 *      Upon sucessful return, this parameter will contain a pointer to
 *      an array of the requested values if the ATSUTextLayout passed

 *      iLineOffset. If this is not the case, then NULL will be
