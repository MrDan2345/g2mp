{
 *  AuthorizationPlugin.h
 *  AuthorizationPlugin -- APIs for implementing authorization plugins.
 }


{!
	@header AuthorizationPlugin
	
	The AuthorizationPlugin API allows the creation of plugins that can participate
	in authorization decisions.  Using the AuthorizationDB API the system can be configured
	to use these plugins.  Plugins are loaded into a separate process, the pluginhost, to 
	isolate the process of authorization from the client.  There are two types of pluginhosts.
	One runs as an anonymous user and can be used to communicate with the user, for example
	to ask for a password.  Another one runs with root privileges to perform privileged
	operations that may be required.

    A typical use is to implement additional policies that cannot be expressed in the
    authorization configuration.
    
    Plugins implement a handshake function called AuthorizationPluginCreate with which
    their interface (AuthorizationPluginInterface) and the engine's interface
    (AuthorizationCallbacks) are exchanged.  Plugins are asked to create 
    Mechanisms, which are the basic element as authorizations are performed.  
    
    Mechanisms are invoked when it is time for them to make a decision.  A decision is 
    made by setting a single result (AuthorizationResult).  Mechanisms in the 
    authorization can communicate auxiliary information by setting and/or getting hints 
    and setting and/or getting context data.  Hints are advisory and don't need to be
    looked at, nor are they preserved as part of the authorization result. Context data
    becomes part of the result of the authorization.
    
    Context data is tagged with a flag that describes whether the information is returned
    to the authorization client upon request (AuthorizationCopyInfo() in Authorization.h)
    or whether it's private to the mechanisms making a decision.
