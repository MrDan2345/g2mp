{
 *  HISegmentedViewCreate()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Creates a segmented view. This is the type of view you would use
 *    to implement the icon/column/list view switcher as seen in the
 *    Finder. 
 *    
 *    After creating a segmented view, you need to set the number of
 *    segments via HISegmentedViewSetSegmentCount. Each segment can be
 *    configured independently using the other HISegmentedView APIs.
 *    
 *    
 *    Changing the number of segments and configuring each segment will
 *    change the appearance of the segmented view. After you configure
 *    the view, you may want to call HIViewGetOptimalBounds on the view
 *    and resize it so the content will fit optimally. 
 *    
 *    The value of the whole segmented view corresponds to the index of
 *    the currently selected segment with the radio behavior. If you
 *    set the value of the whole segmented view to n via
 *    HIViewSetValue, every radio-behavior segment will have its value
 *    set to zero except for the segment at index n; if segment n also
 *    has the radio behavior, it will have its value set to one. When a
 *    radio-behavior segment is clicked, the value of the whole
 *    segmented view will be set to the segment's index. 
 *    
 *    The segmented view works in both compositing and non-compositing
 *    modes.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inBounds:
 *      The bounds of the view to be created. Can be NULL, in which
 *      case the view is created with CGRectZero bounds.
 *    
 *    outRef:
 *      A valid pointer to an HIViewRef. On successful completion of
 *      this routine, the destination HIViewRef will be filled with the
 *      HIViewRef of the newly created view. The view is initially
 *      invisible.

{
 *  HISegmentedViewSetSegmentCount()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Sets the number of segments for the segmented view. Any previous
 *    segments beyond the new count will have their content released.
 *    All new segments beyond the previous count be initialized with
 *    the most basic settings possible: momentary, no attributes, zero
 *    value, enabled, no command, no label, no content, and
 *    auto-calculated content width. You should configure any new
 *    segments to match your needs.

 *  Mac OS X threading:
