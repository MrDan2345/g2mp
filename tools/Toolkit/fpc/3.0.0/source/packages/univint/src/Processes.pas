   Record returned by GetProcessInformation
    When calling GetProcessInformation(), the input ProcessInfoRec
    should have the processInfoLength set to sizeof(ProcessInfoRec),
    the processName field set to nil or a pointer to a Str255, and
    processAppSpec set to nil or a pointer to an FSSpec. If
    processName or processAppSpec are not specified, this routine
    will very likely write data to whatever random location in memory
    these happen to point to, which is not a good thing.
    Note:  The processName field may not be what you expect, especially if
    an application has a localized name. The .processName field, if not NULL,
    on return will contain the filename part of the executable file of the
    application. If you want the localized, user-displayable name for an 
    application, call CopyProcessName().
    On Mac OS X, some flags in processMode will not be set as they were on
    Mac OS 9, even for Classic applications.  Mac OS X doesn't support
    applications which can't be sent into the background, so 
    modeCanBackground will always be set.  Similarly, Mac OS X applications
    will always have mode32BitCompatible and modeHighLevelEventAware
    set.

    Some applications assumed the size of a ProcessInfoRec would never change,
    which has caused problems trying to return additional information. In
    the future, we will add fields to ProcessInfoExtendedRec when necessary,
    and callers which wish to access 'more' data than originally was present
    in ProcessInfoRec should allocate space for a ProcessInfoExtendedRec,
    fill in the processInfoLength ( and processName and processAppSpec ptrs ),
    then coerce this to a ProcessInfoRecPtr in the call to
    GetProcessInformation().

{
 *  [Mac]GetCurrentProcess()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Return the canonical process serial number to the caller.
 *    
 *    All applications ( things which can appear in the Dock or which
 *    are not documents and are launched by the Finder or Dock ) on Mac
 *    OS 10 have a unique process serial number. This number is created
 *    when the application launches, and remains until the application
 *    quits. Other system services, like AppleEvents, use the
 *    ProcessSerialNumber to specify an application.
 *    
 *    During launch, every application 'checks in' with the Process
 *    Manager. Before this checkin, the application can not receive
 *    events or draw to the screen. Prior to Mac OS 10.2, this 'check
 *    in' happened before the applications's main() function was
 *    entered. In Mac OS 10.2 and later, this 'check in' does not
 *    happen until the first time the application calls a Process
 *    Manager function, or until it enters CFRunLoopRun() for the main
 *    runloop. This allows tools and other executables which do not
 *    need to receive events to link against more of the higher level
 *    toolbox frameworks, but may cause a problem if the application
 *    expects to be able to retrieve events or use CoreGraphics
 *    services before this checkin has occurred.
 *    
 *    An application can force the connection to the Process Manager to
 *    be set up by calling any Process Manager routine, but the
 *    recommended way to do this is to call GetCurrentProcess() to ask
 *    for the current application's PSN. This will initialize the
 *    connection to the Process Manager if it has not already been set
 *    up and 'check in' the application with the system.
 *    
 *    This function is named MacGetCurrentProcess() on non Macintosh
 *    platforms and GetCurrentProcess on the Macintosh. However, even
 *    Macintosh code can use the MacGetCurrentProcess() name since
 *    there is a macro which maps back to GetCurrentProcess().
 *    
 *    Lastly, it is usually not necessary to call GetCurrentProcess()
 *    to get the 'current' process psn merely to pass it to another
 *    Process Manager routine. Instead, just construct a
 *    ProcessSerialNumber with 0 in highLongOfPSN and kCurrentProcess
 *    in lowLongOfPSN and pass that. For example, to make the current
 *    process the frontmost process, use ( C code follows )
 *    
 *    ProcessSerialNumber psn = ( 0, kCurrentProcess ); 
 *    
 *    OSErr err = SetFrontProcess( & psn );
 *    
 *    If you need to pass a ProcessSerialNumber to another application
 *    or use it in an AppleEvent, you do need to get the canonical PSN
 *    with this routine.

 *  GetProcessInformation()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Fill in the provided record with information about the process
 *    with the provided process serial number.
 *    
 *    The caller must fill in the .processInfoLength field with the
 *    value sizeof ( ProcessInformationRecord ) before making this
 *    call. Also, the .processName field must point to either NULL or
 *    to a Str31 structure in the caller's memory space, and the
 *    .processAppSpec field must point to a FSSpec in the caller's
 *    memory space.
 *    
 *    If the caller does not care about the process name or the process
 *    application spec values, then setting those fields in the
 *    structure to NULL before this call means less work must be done
 *    to construct these values and so the call is more
 *    efficient.
 *    
 *    The processName field may not be what you expect, especially if
 *    an application has a localized name. The .processName field, if
 *    not NULL, on return will contain the filename part of the
 *    executable file of the application. If you want the localized,
 *    user-displayable name for an application, call
 *    CopyProcessName().
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X, the processSize and processFreeMem fields are
 *    returned with the value 0.
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X 10.6 and later, the processLaunchDate field is an
 *    integer value with the same scale as CFAbsoluteTime.  Prior
 *    releases used a value in 60th of a second with a random zero
 *    time, making it difficult to use. Since most applications just
 *    look at the comparison from this field to other launch dates this

 *  Discussion:
 *    Given a psn for an application, this call transforms that

 *    have a menu bar, do not appear in the dock, but may in limited
 *    circumstances present windows and user interface. If a foreground
 *    application is frontmost when transformed into a background
 *    application, it is first hidden and another application is made
 *    frontmost.  A UIElement or background-only application which is
 *    transformed into a foreground application is not brought to the
 *    front (use SetFrontProcess() after the transform if this is
 *    required) nor will it be shown if it is hidden ( even if hidden
 *    automatically by being transformed into a background-only
 *    application ), so the caller should use ShowHideProcess() to show
 *    the application after it is transformed into a foreground
 *    application. Applications can only transform themselves; this
