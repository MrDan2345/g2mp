 *  HIArchive
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    HIArchive provides a standard, extensible mechanism to flatten
 *    objects for storage in memory or on disk for later retrieval or
 *    transfer to another application. The archive is encoded using the
 *    binary property list format. The binary plist can be converted to
 *    text XML with /usr/bin/plutil for development purposes. Details
 *    on how to create an object that supports the HIArchive protocol
 *    are provided in HIToolbox/HIObject.h. 
 *    
 *    When writing data out to an archive, the client must first use
 *    HIArchiveCreateForEncoding to generate the archive into which the
 *    data will be encoded. From there, data may be added to the
 *    archive by calling HIArchiveEncodeBoolean, HIArchiveEncodeNumber,
 *    and HIArchiveEncodeCFType. If HIArchiveEncodeCFType is being
 *    called on one of your custom HIObjects, HIToolbox will send it
 *    the kEventHIObjectEncode event (see HIObject.h). In order to
 *    receive this event your HIObject must first have set its
 *    archiving-ignored value to false via HIObjectSetArchivingIgnored.
 *    This lets HIToolbox know your object supports archiving. The
 *    kEventParamHIArchive parameter contains the HIArchiveRef into
 *    which it should encode all of its relevant state information. All
 *    information added to the archive is written with a key. This key
 *    is used later during the unarchiving process to pull the encoded
 *    data from the archive. System supplied HIObjects namespace their
 *    keys with an HI prefix. Subclasses of system supplied HIObjects
 *    should only use this namespace if explicitly overriding a value
 *    written to the archive by the superclass. Take care to mantain
 *    the same data format when overriding the default to avoid
 *    incompatibilities. When your archiving process is complete,
 *    HIArchiveCopyEncodedData will compress the data into the archive
 *    and return it in a CFDataRef. This CFDataRef can be sent to
 *    another application or written out to disk for later retrieval.
 *    Once the encoded data is compressed, no more data may be added to
 *    the archive. At this point, the HIArchiveRef must be released via
 *    CFRelease. 
 *    
 *    When retrieving data from an archive, the client must first use
 *    HIArchiveCreateForDecoding to create an archive reference capable
 *    of decoding the data from the provided CFDataRef. Given the
 *    HIArchiveRef, data may be pulled from the archive via
 *    HIArchiveDecodeBoolean, HIArchiveDecodeNumber, and
 *    HIArchiveCopyDecodedCFType. If HIArchiveCopyDecodedCFType is
 *    called on one of your custom HIObjects, HIToolbox will send it
 *    the kEventHIObjectInitialize event (see HIOject.h). The
 *    kEventParamHIArchive parameter contains the HIArchiveRef from
 *    which it should decode all of its relevant state information.
 *    Because these data values were written by key, they can be read
 *    in any order regardless of how they were written. This also means
 *    new keyed values can be added without breaking existing decoding
 *    routines. Once all data has been read from the archive, it may
 *    simply be released via CFRelease. 
 *    
 *    For those clients who wish to provide HIArchive editing features
 *    there are a few tricks necessary to achieve the desired behavior.
 *    A generic HIArchive editor will likely be used by clients to edit
 *    objects for which it has no direct knowledge (or which have not
 *    yet been designed). For instance, it may provide users with the
 *    ability to edit custom HIViews, including generic functionality
 *    to set the view's class identifier, title, frame, etc. In this
 *    case, it is necessary to instantiate the superclass
 *    ("com.apple.hiview") of the custom view object because the custom
 *    view class itself hasn't been registered within the editor.
 *    
 *    
 *    After the user has completed editing the object and desires to
 *    write out the archive, the editor must set the custom archive
 *    data to the object with HIObjectSetCustomArchiveData as a
 *    CFDictionary. Standard keys for initialization parameter types,
 *    names and values, class and superclass identifiers and CDEF
 *    procID are provided in HIToolbox/HIObject.h. Of particular
 *    importance are the object's class and superclass identifier.
 *    HIArchive uses these values to instantiate the proper object when
 *    loading the archive within the client's application. The
 *    parameter types, names and values are then automatically passed
 *    to the client object through its initialization event. 
 *    
 *    At this point, the object can simply be written into the archive
 *    with HIArchiveCreateForEncoding and HIArchiveEncodeCFType.
 *    HIArchive will handle writing the appropriate classID based on
 *    the custom data that was assigned earlier. 
 *    
 *    Generic HIArchive editing applications will also need to handle
 *    loading client archives. In this case, the archive is decoded in
 *    editing mode by passing the
 *    kHIArchiveDecodeSuperclassForUnregisteredObjects proxy bit in
 *    HIArchiveCreateForDecoding. When objects not registered in the
 *    current application are decoded, HIArchive will notice this and
 *    look into the custom data for the object's superclass identifier,
 *    instantiate an object of that type instead and attach the custom
 *    data to the newly created object. The editor can then look at the
 *    attached custom data with HIObjectCopyCustomArchiveData and
 *    provide it in the UI for the user to edit.

   * yet registered "com.myco.customview". This is useful for archive
   * editors that do not implement all objects contained in a client
   * archive. Note that only data written to the archive by the
   * superclass will be decoded. All data unique to the unregistered
   * subclass will be ignored. This option also signals the HIObject to

{
 *  HIArchiveCopyDecodedCFType()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Pulls a keyed CFType from the provided archive.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Decodes basic and property list based CFTypes and HIObjects. If
 *    the CFType is an HIObject, it will be constructed and receive the
 *    kEventHIObjectInitialize event. The kEventParamHIArchive
 *    parameter contains the archive from which data should be
 *    retrieved.

 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inDecoder:
 *      An HIArchiveRef from which the CFType value is pulled.
 *    
 *    inKey:
 *      The key associated with the CFType used while encoding.
 *    
 *    outCFType:
 *      The CFType to be decoded.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An operating system result code.
