{!
	@header Authorization
	Version 1.0 10/16/2000

	The Authorization API contains all the APIs that a application or tool that need pre-authorization or need an authorization desision made.
	
	A typical use cases are a preference panel that would start off calling AuthorizationCreate() (without UI) to get an authorization object.  Then call AuthorizationCopyRights() to figure out what is currently allowed.
	
	If any of the operations that the preference panel wishes to perform are currently not allowed the lock icon in the window would show up in the locked state.  Otherwise it would show up unlocked.
	
	When the user locks the lock AuthorizationFree() is called with the kAuthorizationFlagDestroyRights to destroy any authorization rights that have been aquired.
	
	When the user unlocks the lock AuthorizationCreate() is called with the kAuthorizationFlagInteractionAllowed and kAuthorizationFlagExtendRights flags to obtain all required rights.  The old authorization object can be freed by calling AuthorizationFree() with no flags.

{!
    @function AuthorizationCreate
    Create a new autorization object which can be used in other authorization calls.  When the authorization is no longer needed AuthorizationFree should be called.

	When the kAuthorizationFlagInteractionAllowed flag is set, user interaction will happen when required.  Failing to set this flag will result in this call failing with a errAuthorizationInteractionNotAllowed status when interaction is required.

	Setting the kAuthorizationFlagExtendRights flag will extend the currently available rights. If this flag is set the returned AuthorizationRef will grant all the rights requested when errAuthorizationSuccess is returned. If this flag is not set the operation will almost certainly succeed, but no attempt will be made to make the requested rights availible.
		Call AuthorizationCopyRights to figure out which of the requested rights are granted by the returned AuthorizationRef.

	Setting the kAuthorizationFlagPartialRights flag will cause this call to succeed if only some of the requested rights are being granted by the returned AuthorizationRef. Unless this flag is set this API will fail if not all the requested rights could be obtained.

	Setting the kAuthorizationFlagDestroyRights flag will prevent any rights obtained during this call from being preserved after returning from this API (This is most useful when the authorization parameter is NULL and the caller doesn't want to affect the session state in any way).

	Setting the kAuthorizationFlagPreAuthorize flag will pre authorize the requested rights so that at a later time -- by calling AuthorizationMakeExternalForm() follow by AuthorizationCreateFromExternalForm() -- the obtained rights can be used in a different process.  Rights that can't be preauthorized will be treated as if they were authorized for the sake of returning an error (in other words if all rights are either authorized or could not be preauthorized this call will still succeed).
		The rights which could not be preauthorized are not currently authorized and may fail to authorize when a later call to AuthorizationCopyRights() is made, unless the kAuthorizationFlagExtendRights and kAuthorizationFlagInteractionAllowed flags are set.  Even then they might still fail if the user does not supply the correct credentials.
		The reason for passing in this flag is to provide correct audit trail information and to avoid unnecessary user interaction.

    @param rights (input/optional) An AuthorizationItemSet containing rights for which authorization is being requested.  If none are specified the resulting AuthorizationRef will authorize nothing at all.
    @param environment (input/optional) An AuthorizationItemSet containing enviroment state used when making the autorization decision.  See the AuthorizationEnvironment type for details.
    @param flags (input) options specified by the AuthorizationFlags enum.  set all unused bits to zero to allow for future expansion.
    @param authorization (output optional) A pointer to an AuthorizationRef to be returned.  When the returned AuthorizationRef is no longer needed AuthorizationFree should be called to prevent anyone from using the aquired rights.  If NULL is specified no new rights are returned, but the system will attempt to authorize all the requested rights and return the appropriate status.

    @result errAuthorizationSuccess 0 authorization or all requested rights succeeded.

	errAuthorizationDenied -60005 The authorization for one or more of the requested rights was denied.

	errAuthorizationCanceled -60006 The authorization was cancelled by the user.

	errAuthorizationInteractionNotAllowed -60007 The authorization was denied since no interaction with the user was allowed.

{!
    @function AuthorizationFree
    Destroy an AutorizationRef object. If the kAuthorizationFlagDestroyRights flag is passed,
	any rights associated with the authorization are lost. Otherwise, only local resources
	are released, and the rights may still be available to other clients.

	Setting the kAuthorizationFlagDestroyRights flag will prevent any rights that were obtained by the specified authorization object to be preserved after returning from this API.  This effectivaly locks down all potentially shared authorizations.

    @param authorization (input) The authorization object on which this operation is performed.
	
	@param flags (input) Bit mask of option flags to this call.

    @result errAuthorizationSuccess 0 No error.

    errAuthorizationInvalidRef -60002 The authorization parameter is invalid.

{!
	@function AuthorizationCopyRights
    Given a set of rights, return the subset that is currently authorized
    by the AuthorizationRef given.

	When the kAuthorizationFlagInteractionAllowed flag is set, user interaction will happen when required.  Failing to set this flag will result in this call failing with a errAuthorizationInteractionNotAllowed status when interaction is required.

	Setting the kAuthorizationFlagExtendRights flag will extend the currently available rights.

	Setting the kAuthorizationFlagPartialRights flag will cause this call to succeed if only some of the requested rights are being granted by the returned AuthorizationRef.  Unless this flag is set this API will fail if not all the requested rights could be obtained.

	Setting the kAuthorizationFlagDestroyRights flag will prevent any additional rights obtained during this call from being preserved after returning from this API.

	Setting the kAuthorizationFlagPreAuthorize flag will pre authorize the requested rights so that at a later time -- by calling AuthorizationMakeExternalForm() follow by AuthorizationCreateFromExternalForm() -- the obtained rights can be used in a different process.  Rights that can't be preauthorized will be treated as if they were authorized for the sake of returning an error (in other words if all rights are either authorized or could not be preauthorized this call will still succeed), and they will be returned in authorizedRights with their kAuthorizationFlagCanNotPreAuthorize bit in the flags field set to 1.
		The rights which could not be preauthorized are not currently authorized and may fail to authorize when a later call to AuthorizationCopyRights() is made, unless the kAuthorizationFlagExtendRights and kAuthorizationFlagInteractionAllowed flags are set.  Even then they might still fail if the user does not supply the correct credentials.
		The reason for passing in this flag is to provide correct audit trail information and to avoid unnecessary user interaction.

	Setting the kAuthorizationFlagPreAuthorize flag will pre authorize the requested rights so that at a later time -- by calling AuthorizationMakeExternalForm() follow by AuthorizationCreateFromExternalForm() -- the obtained rights can be used in a different process.  When this flags is specified rights that can't be preauthorized will be returned as if they were authorized with their kAuthorizationFlagCanNotPreAuthorize bit in the flags field set to 1.  These rights are not currently authorized and may fail to authorize later unless kAuthorizationFlagExtendRights and kAuthorizationFlagInteractionAllowed flags are set when the actual authorization is done.  And even then they might still fail if the user does not supply the correct credentials.

    @param authorization (input) The authorization object on which this operation is performed.
    @param rights (input) A rights set (see AuthorizationCreate).
    @param environment (input/optional) An AuthorizationItemSet containing enviroment state used when making the autorization decision.  See the AuthorizationEnvironment type for details.

    @param authorizedRights (output/optional) A pointer to a newly allocated AuthorizationInfoSet in which the authorized subset of rights are returned (authorizedRights should be deallocated by calling AuthorizationFreeItemSet() when it is no longer needed).  If NULL the only information returned is the status.  Note that if the kAuthorizationFlagPreAuthorize flag was specified rights that could not be preauthorized are returned in authorizedRights, but their flags contains the kAuthorizationFlagCanNotPreAuthorize bit.
