 *    event loop is run implicitly thru APIs like ReceiveNextEvent,
 *    RunApplicationEventLoop, or even WaitNextEvent. It can also be
 *    run explicitly thru a call to RunCurrentEventLoop. Each
 *    preemptive thread can have an event loop. Cooperative threads

 *  Discussion:
 *    Causes a specific event loop to terminate. Usage of this is

 *    Typically this call is used in conjunction with
 *    RunCurrentEventLoop. 
 *    
 *    Note that this call is meant to be used while the event loop is
 *    running; i.e., you would typically call this API from a timer
 *    callback or some other callback that is invoked by

 *  CreateEventWithCGEvent()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Creates a Carbon event using the contents of a CGEventRef. The

 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inAllocator:
 *      The CFAllocator to use to allocate the event data. You can pass
 *      NULL or kCFAllocatorDefault to use the standard allocator.
 *    
 *    inEvent:
 *      The CGEventRef from which the Carbon event should be created.
 *      This parameter will be retained by the Carbon event, and
 *      released when the Carbon event is released.
 *    
 *    inAttributes:
 *      The event attributes. Typically this should be

 *    example, kEventWindowUpdate has no CGEventRef. For such events,
 *    this API returns NULL.

 *    may release the event, since it is retained by the queue. If the

 *    posted. 
 *    
 *    If the event is posted to the main event queue, then the event
 *    will be retrieved and dispatched by a subsequent call to the
 *    event loop by the main thread. If the event is posted to an event
 *    queue of a non-main thread, then that thread must be running its

 *    to an appropriate event target (such as the specified window); if
 *    the event uses a custom event class, then the event dispatcher
 *    will send the event to the application target. 
 *    
 *    For custom event classes, you may specify a destination event
 *    target other than the application target by adding the

{
 *  GetCurrentEventButtonState()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Returns the current queue-synchronized mouse button state on the
 *    primary input device.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    At any point in the handling of user input, there are two
 *    different mouse button states: the queue-synchronized state and
 *    the hardware state. The hardware state reflects the actual
 *    current state of the mouse attached to the user's machine. The
 *    queue-synchronized state reflects the state according to the
 *    events that have been processed at that point by the application.
 *    These two states may be different if there are unprocessed events
 *    in the event queue, or if events are being artificially
 *    introduced into the event queue from an outside source.
 *    GetCurrentEventButtonState returns the queue-synchronized button
 *    state. This state is determined by user input events that are
 *    sent through the event dispatcher target; whenever a user input
 *    event (mouse or keyboard) is handled by the Carbon event
 *    dispatcher, its button state is recorded, and that button state
 *    will be returned by GetCurrentEventButtonState. 
 *    
 *    The "current event" referenced in the API name is the event most
 *    recently dispatched through the event dispatcher target, which is
 *    not necessarily the event that your event handler is handling.
 *    For example, if a mouse-down event occurs, and you have a handler
 *    for the kEventWindowHandleContentClick event that is generated
 *    from the mouse-down, then the button state will be that which was
 *    attached to the mouse-down. The ContentClick event itself does
 *    also have MouseButton and MouseChord parameters, which are copied
 *    from the the mouse-down event, but GetCurrentEventButtonState

 *    directly from user input, you can use GetCurrentEventButtonState,

{
 *  GetCurrentEventKeyModifiers()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Returns the current queue-synchronized keyboard modifier state.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    At any point in the handling of user input, there are two
 *    different keyboard modifier states: the queue-synchronized state
 *    and the hardware state. The hardware state reflects the actual
 *    current state of the keyboard attached to the user's machine. The
 *    queue-synchronized state reflects the state according to the
 *    events that have been processed at that point by the application.
 *    These two states may be different if there are unprocessed events
 *    in the event queue, or if events are being artificially
 *    introduced into the event queue from an outside source.
 *    GetCurrentEventKeyModifiers returns the queue-synchronized
 *    modifier state. This state is determined by user input events
 *    that are sent through the event dispatcher target; whenever a
 *    user input event (mouse or keyboard) is handled by the Carbon
 *    event dispatcher, its modifiers are recorded, and those modifiers
 *    will be returned by GetCurrentEventKeyModifiers. 
 *    
 *    The "current event" referenced in the API name is the event most
 *    recently dispatched through the event dispatcher target, which is
 *    not necessarily the event that your event handler is handling.
 *    For example, if a mouse-down event occurs, and you have a handler
 *    for the kEventWindowHandleContentClick event that is generated
 *    from the mouse-down, then the modifiers will be those that were
 *    attached to the mouse-down. The ContentClick event itself does
 *    also have a KeyModifiers parameter, which is copied from the
 *    mouse-down event, but GetCurrentEventKeyModifiers returns the
 *    modifiers from the mouse-down, not from the ContentClick event,
 *    since it was the mouse-down that was most recently dispatched
 *    through the event dispatcher. Usually, this is the behavior that
 *    you want anyways. 
 *    
 *    Note that events that are not sent through the event dispatcher
 *    target will not update the current event key modifiers. Also,
 *    note that events arriving from outside the application, such as
 *    an AppleEvent or an Accessibility event, also will not update the
 *    modifiers. If your application modifies its behavior based on
 *    modifier state, we recommend that you parameterize your core code
 *    with the event modifiers, and determine the modifiers based on
 *    the origin of the behavior request. For a request that originates
 *    directly from user input, you can use

{
 *  EventLoopTimerRef
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    An EventLoopTimerRef represents what we term a 'timer'. A timer
 *    is a function that is called either once or at regular intervals.
 *    It executes at task level and should not be confused with Time
 *    Manager Tasks or any other interrupt-level callback. This means
 *    you can call Toolbox routines, allocate memory and draw. When a
 *    timer 'fires', it calls a callback that you specify when the
 *    timer is installed. Timers in general have two uses - as a
 *    timeout mechanism and as a periodic task. An everyday example of
 *    using a timer for a timeout might be a light that goes out if no
 *    motion is detected in a room for 5 minutes. For this, you might
 *    install a timer which will fire in 5 minutes. If motion is
 *    detected, you would reset the timer fire time and let the clock
 *    start over. If no motion is detected for the full 5 minutes, the
 *    timer will fire and you could power off the light. A periodic
 *    timer is one that fires at regular intervals (say every second or
 *    so). You might use such a timer to blink the insertion point in
 *    your editor, etc. One advantage of timers is that you can install
 *    the timer right from the code that wants the time. For example,
 *    the standard Toolbox Edit Text control can install a timer to
 *    blink the cursor when it's active, meaning that IdleControls is a
 *    no-op for that control and doesn't need to be called. When the
 *    control is inactive, it removes its timer and doesn't waste CPU
 *    time in that state. NOTE: Currently, if you do decide to draw
 *    when your timer is called, be sure to save and restore the
 *    current port so that calling your timer doesn't inadvertently
 *    change the port out from under someone.

 *      The target to send it to.
 *    
 *    inOptions:
 *      The options to modify the send behavior. Passing zero for this
 *      makes it behave just like SendEventToEventTarget.
 *  
 *  Result:

 *  Discussion:
 *    When secure event input is enabled, keyboard input will only go

 *    other applications that might be using the event monitor target
 *    to watch keyboard input. The EditText and EditUnicodeText
 *    controls automatically enter secure input mode when a password
 *    control has the focus; if your application implements its own
 *    password entry, you should enable secure event input while the
 *    user is entering text.
 *    
 *    This API maintains a count of the number of times that it has
 *    been called. Secure event input is not disabled until
 *    DisableSecureEventInput has been called the same number of
 *    times.
 *    
 *    Be sure to disable secure event input if your application becomes
 *    inactive. If your application crashes, secure event input will
 *    automatically be disabled if no other application has enabled it.
