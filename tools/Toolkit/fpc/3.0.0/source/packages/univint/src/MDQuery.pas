        @header MDQuery

        MDQuery is a CF-compliant object, and follows the CF conventions,
        and can be used with the CF polymorphic functions, like CFRetain().

        MDQuery encapsulates all queries against the MetaData
        database. Queries gather results or process updates only while
        the current thread's run loop is running. Queries normally
        operate asynchronously, and only send out progress
        notificiations as the list is being collected. The query list
        is kept up to date with respect to value lists and sorting as
        the progress notifications are sent out, so the query is in a
        good state during those events.

        Result Retreval
                An MDQueryRef presents its results as if it were a simple
                array object.  The results can either be MDItemRefs (the
                default) or custom structs, CFTypeRefs, or Objective C
                objects.  For example if the result objects are represented
                as 'FSNodes' (a type defined in the client application) a
                call to MDQueryGetResultAtIndex() will return an FSNode
                object. This is useful, because it allows the Metadata
                library to maintain the results in a form that is directly
                useable in the application.

        Query Sorting
                Sorting the results from a query can be performed in one  of
                two ways. First is to let the library sort the results for you
                by passing an array of attributes to sort on to
                MDQueryCreate(). The default sort provided by MDQueryCreate()
                is a assending sort strings are compared using
                CFStringCompare() with the options kCFCompareNonliteral |
                kCFCompareLocalized | kCFCompareNumerically. CFDataRefs are
                compared by using memcmp() of the data pointers. If an Item
                does not have the attribute, it compares less than the
                attribute that is there.

                If you need to do a more complex sort (like a case insensitive
                sort on CFStringRefs) then you will need to also provide a
                comparitor function and call MDQuerySetSortComparator(), and
                also provide which attributes to sort on to MDQueryCreate().

        Undefined Behavior
                For functions which take an MDQueryRef parameter, if this
                parameter is not a valid MDQueryRef, the behavior is
                undefined. NULL is not a valid MDQueryRef.

                For functions which take CF*Ref parameters, such as
                CFStringRef and CFArrayRef, if this parameter is not a
                valid CF object of the correct type, the behavior is
                undefined. NULL is not a valid CF*Ref.

                Additional constraints or allowed values on parameters
                are noted with the specific functions.

                If this parameter is true, the function will not return
                until the query has finished gathering the initial
                results. The run loop will run in the default mode, which
                will allow anything registered in that mode with this run
                loop to execute as well. If this parameter is false, the
                function returns immediately after starting the query
                asychronously.
        @constant kMDQueryWantsUpdates When set, after gathering the initial results
                the query will watch for changes in the system which should
                update the list of results. This can be changes which cause
                new files to now match the query, or changes which cause
                files in the result list to continue to match, or no longer
                match, the query. Files which begin to match the query are
                added to the result list, and files which no longer match
                the query expression are removed from the result list.
                Currently, this parameter is ignored if the synchronous
                parameter is true. This is subject to change, and you
                should always pass in the value you want here.

                The create-result function is called lazily as results

                the default result objects are MDItemRefs. Results
                created after a create function is set will be created

                can be reused for multiple query creations. Only version
                0 of the CFArrayCallBacks is supported. The retain field
                may be NULL, in which case the MDQuery will do nothing to
                add a retain to the created results for the query. The
                release field may be NULL, in which case the MDQuery will
                do nothing to remove the query's retain (such as the one
                it gets from the create function) on the result objects
                when the query is destroyed. If the copyDescription field
                is NULL, the query will create a simple description for
                the result objects. If the equal field is NULL, the query
                will use pointer equality to test for equality of results.
                This callbacks parameter itself may be NULL, which is
                treated as if a valid structure of version 0 with all

                the callback functions, the behavior when those callback
                functions are used is undefined. For example, if the create
                function can return NULL, then NULL must be understood by
                the callback functions as a possible parameter. The retain
                and release callbacks must be a matched set -- do not
                assume that the retain function will be unused or that

                notifications to report changes to the list of results
                that has been collected. Queries have two phases: the
                initial gathering of all currently matching results, and
                a second live-update phase where queries monitor the
                state of the system and update themselves to external
                changes in files or the operating environment (for example,
                as time advances, files which did not match the query
                when it was started may later match the query). Query
                notifications are posted within the context of the same
