 * @defgroup DBus D-Bus low-level public API
 * @brief The low-level public API of the D-Bus library
 *
 * libdbus provides a low-level API intended primarily for use by
 * bindings to specific object systems and languages.  D-Bus is most
 * convenient when used with the GLib bindings, Python bindings, Qt
 * bindings, Mono bindings, and so forth.  This low-level API has a
 * lot of complexity useful only for bindings.
