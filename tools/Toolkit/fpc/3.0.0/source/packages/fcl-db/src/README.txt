This is the Database directory of the Free Component Library.

All base classes are in the db unit; the dbconst unit contains the 
used resourcestrings.

memds
  contains a dataset class in memory which can be read from, and
  written to a stream

sqldb
  contains a framework to work with several SQL-based databases such
  as Interbase, Firebird, MySQL, ODBC, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, 
	PostgreSQL, SQLite3 and Sybase ASE

dbase
  contains the tDbf components, to work with DBASE, FoxPro and Visual
	FoxPro file-based databases

sdf
  contains a dataset class to use text files directly as a
  database. That could be fixed-size, or delimited (RFC 4180 CSV)

sqlite
  contains dataset classes to use sqlite and sqlite3

Good luck !
