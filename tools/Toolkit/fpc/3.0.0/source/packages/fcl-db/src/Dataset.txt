General remarks
===============
- All fields and descendents implemented.
- No calculated fields.
- No persistent fields; this must be added later.


=============
Fields system
=============
Buffers are completely handled by the Dataset. Fields don't handle
their own buffers. The FValueBuffer of the field is only used during
validation.

This allows the dataset to allocate a number of buffers for the current
record and the N next records. (getnextrecords/getpriorrecords method)

This means that all field mechanisms MUST pass through GetData/SetData,
since FValueBuffer is only valid during validation.

===========
The Buffers
===========
A buffer contains all the data for 1 record of the dataset, and also
the bookmark information. Bookmark information is REQUIRED.

The dataset allocates by default 'DefaultBufferCount+1' records(buffers)
This constant can be changed at the beginning of dataset.inc, e.g.
if you know you'll be working with big datasets, you can 
increase this constant.

The buffers are stored as pchars in the FBuffers array;
The following constants are userd when handling this array:

FBufferCount :   The number of buffers allocated, minus one.
FRecordCount :   The number of buffers that is actually filled in.
FActiveBuffer :  The index of the active record in TDataset.
FCurrentRecord : The index of the supposedly active record in the underlying
                 dataset (ie. the index in the last call to SetToInternalRecord)
                 Call CursorPosChanged to reset FCurrentRecord if the active
                 record in the underlaying dataset has changed.

So the following picture follows from this:

+---------------+
|  0            |
+---------------+
|  1            |
+---------------+
|               |
   ...
|               |
+---------------+
| FActivebuffer |
+---------------+
|               |
    ...
|               |
+---------------+
|FRecordCount-1 |
+---------------+
|               |
  ...
|               |
+---------------+
| FBufferCount  |
+---------------+ 

The array is zero based. 

The following methods are used to manipulate the array:

GetNextRecords: tries to fill up the entire array, going forward
GetPriorRecords: tries to fill up the entire array, going backward
GetNextRecord: gets the next record. Shifts the array if FRecordCount=BufferCount-1
GetPriorRecord: gets the previous record. Shifts the array if FRecordCount=BufferCount-1

For the last 2 methods: the underlying record pointer must be on the 
last/first record in the dataset, or things will go wrong.

resync tries to refresh the array from the underlying dataset; it uses the
bookmarks for that.

=======================
Dataset implementations
=======================

TDataset does most of the work associated with fields, buffers and
navigating/editing/adding/removing records of some source of data. 
There are, however, some methods that need to be filled in so that 
a real TDataset can be implemented. 

In order to have a working Dataset, the following Methods need to be 
overridden in order to make a dataset descendant:

function AllocRecordBuffer: PChar; virtual; abstract;
-----------------------------------------------------
Must allocate enough memory to store a complete record in the dataset.
Optionally, this buffer must contain enough memory to store bookmark data.
The descendent must be able to construct a bookmark from this buffer.

procedure FreeRecordBuffer(var Buffer: PChar); virtual; abstract;
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Must free the memory allocated in the AllocRecordBuffer call.

procedure GetBookmarkData(Buffer: PChar; Data: Pointer); virtual; abstract;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Puts the bookmark data for Buffer into the area pointed to by Data.

function GetBookmarkFlag(Buffer: PChar): TBookmarkFlag; virtual; abstract;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Returns the bookmarkflag associated with Buffer.

function GetFieldData(Field: TField; Buffer: Pointer): Boolean; virtual; abstract;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Puts the data for field Field from the active buffer into Buffer. 
This is called whenever a field value is demanded, so it must be
efficient.

function GetRecord(Buffer: PChar; GetMode: TGetMode; DoCheck: Boolean): TGetResult; virtual; abstract;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This method must do 3 things:
1) Get the record data for the next/current/previous record, depending
   on the GetMode value. It should return 
    grOK    if all was OK.
    grBOF   if the previous record was requested, and we are at the start. 
    grEOF   if the next record was requested, and we are at the end.
    grError if an error occurred.
   
2) If DoCheck is True, and the result is grError, then an exception must be
   raised.

3) It should initialize bookmark data for this record with flag 'bfCurrent'
   This data can be stored in the buffer, if space was allocated for it with
   AllocRecordBuffer.
 
function GetRecordSize: Word; virtual; abstract;
------------------------------------------------
Should return the record size - this includes ONLY the data portion
of the buffer. It excludes any bookmark or housekeeping info you may
have put in the buffer.

procedure InternalAddRecord(Buffer: Pointer; Append: Boolean); virtual; abstract;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adds a record to the dataset. The record's data is in Buffer and Append
indicates whether the record should be appended (True) or Inserted (False).
Note that for SQL based datasets, this has no meaning.

procedure InternalClose; virtual; abstract;
-------------------------------------------
Closes the dataset. Any resources allocated in InternalOpen should be freed
here.

procedure InternalDelete; virtual; abstract;
--------------------------------------------
Deletes the current Record.

procedure InternalFirst; virtual; abstract;
-------------------------------------------
This is called when 'First' is called. After this method, getrecord
should return 'grBOF' if the previous record is requested, and it should
return the next record if the next record is requested.

procedure InternalGotoBookmark(ABookmark: Pointer); virtual; abstract;
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Set the record position on the position that is associated with the
ABookMark data. The ABookMark data is the data that is acquired through
the GetBookMarkData call, and should be kept for each record.

procedure InternalHandleException; virtual; abstract;
-----------------------------------------------------
This procedure can try to handle exceptions raised in the Dataset, and 
raise an exception if it cannot handle it.
If not used, just implement an empty call (as is currently done with
most datasets).

procedure InternalInitFieldDefs; virtual; abstract;
---------------------------------------------------
This method should be called from InternalOpen, and should
initialize FieldDef definitions for all fields in a record.
It should add these definitions to the FFielddefs object.

procedure InternalInitRecord(Buffer: PChar); virtual; abstract;
---------------------------------------------------------------
This method is called to initialize a field buffer when the dataset
is put into edit or append mode. Mostly, you'll want to zero out the 
buffer.

procedure InternalLast; virtual; abstract;
------------------------------------------
This is called when 'Last' is called. After this method, getrecord
should return 'grEOF' if the next record is requested, and it should
return the last record if the previous record is requested.

procedure InternalOpen; virtual; abstract;
------------------------------------------
Open the dataset. You must call internalinitfielddefs.
If DefaultFields is True, then you must call CreateFields,
which will create the necessary TFields from the fielddefs.

procedure InternalPost; virtual; abstract;
------------------------------------------
Post the data in the active buffer to the underlying dataset.

procedure InternalSetToRecord(Buffer: PChar); virtual; abstract;
----------------------------------------------------------------
Set the current record to the record in Buffer; if bookmark data 
is specified in this buffer, that data can be used to determine which 
record this should be.

function IsCursorOpen: Boolean; virtual; abstract;
--------------------------------------------------
This function should return True if data is available, even if the dataset
is not active.

procedure SetBookmarkFlag(Buffer: PChar; Value: TBookmarkFlag); virtual; abstract;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set the bookmarkflag 'Value' on the data in Buffer.

procedure SetBookmarkData(Buffer: PChar; Data: Pointer); virtual; abstract;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move the bookmark data in 'Data' to the bookmark data associated with Buffer

procedure SetFieldData(Field: TField; Buffer: Pointer); virtual; abstract;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move the data associated with Field from Buffer to the active record buffer.
This procedure is called after inserting/editing field data.


===================
Switchable datasets
===================
In order to have flexible database access, the concept of TDatabase and
TDBDataset is introduced. The idea is that, in a visual IDE, the change
from one database to another is achieved by simply removing one TDatabase
descendent (say, TMySqlDatabase) with another (say, TPostGreSQLDatabase)
and that the Datasets remain untouched.

In order to make this possible, the following scheme is used:
when a TDBdataset descendant is put on Active, it requests a TRecordSet
from the TDatabase. The TRecordSet is an abstract object that should be
implemented together with each database. The TDBDataset then uses the
TRecordSet to navigate through the records and edit/add/modify them.
The TDBdataset implements the abstract methods of Tdataset in order to
achieve this.

There will be 2 descendants of TDBdataset: TTable and TQuery; both will
implement the final abstract methods of TDataset in order to achieve a
complete TDataset implementation.

TDBDataset implements most of the initialization of fields, so the
implementation of TRecordSet will be as bare bones as possible.

What is needed:
---------------
Some properties describing the data:

FieldCount        : Number of fields in a record.
FieldTypes[Index] : Types of the fields (TFieldType). Zero based.
FieldNames[Index] : Names of the fields. Zero based.
FieldSizes[index] : Size of the fields. Zero based.
BookmarkSize      : Size of a bookmark.

Some properties with the data content:

FieldBuffers[Index] : Buffers containing the actual data of the current record.
                      (Nil if the field is empty)
                      This data should be of size indicated in FieldSizes, and 
                      in a format that matches the fieldtype.
BookMarkBuffer      : Buffer with the current bookmark.

Some methods
------------
OpenRecordSet  : Opens the recordset. It should initialize the FieldCount 
                 and FieldTypes, FieldNames, and FieldSizes array data.

CloseRecordSet : Do whatever is needed to close the recordset.

GotoBookMark   : go to the record described by the bookmark. Returns true
                 if successful, False if not.

Next           : Go to the next record. Returns true or false.
Prior          : Go to the previous record. Returns true or false.
First          : Go to the first record. Returns true or false.
Last           : Go to the last record. Returns true or false.

AppendBuffer   : Append a buffer to the records.
