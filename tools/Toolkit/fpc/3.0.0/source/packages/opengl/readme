New Free Pascal OpenGL (GL, GLU, GLUT, GLX) Units
GLX unit (c) 1999-2002 Sebastian Guenther, sg@freepascal.org
other units adapted to Free Pascal from the delphi3d.net units
by Tom Nuydens (tom@delphi3d.net), see http://www.delphi3d.net/

You might have a look at the original readme, glunits.txt, as well 


Some remarks:
* The new OpenGL units are not 100% compatible to the old ones; the new units
  use exactly the same function declarations as their C counterpart.
* Platform compatiblity: You can work on all targets exactly as on Win32;
  for example, you can use wglGetProcAddress for loading OpenGL extensions even
  on Unix based systems. A future release of the glext unit might have helper
  functions for loading specific extensions. (There is a small problem with
  Free Pascal: In FPC mode, you cannot assign a pointer, as returned by
  wglGetProcAddress, to a variable which holds a function pointer. Currently
  you have to compile your programs in Delphi mode, if they are using OpenGL
  extensions)
* GLUT on Win32: Get the glut32.dll from here:

* GTKGLArea: The GL Area widget for GTK is available in the GTK package
