This directory contains only RTL parts specific to the processor I386 family.

(They are specific because they contain assembler instructions)

Include files for system are :
  heap.inc (heap handling)
  set.inc  (sets operations)
  math.inc (mathematic operations using the coprocessor)
  i386.inc (several functions/procedures containing assembler parts)
  setjump.inc (setjmp/longjmp implementation for exceptions)
  rttip.inc (rtti handling, for speed reasons)
  
Units are :
  strings.pp (written in assembler for speed)
  cpu.pp     (routines to access cpu info)
  mmx.pp     (special mmx routines)
