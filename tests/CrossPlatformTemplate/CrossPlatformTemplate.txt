while the previous examples are already portable across windows, linux and mac os platforms, this is not the case for the other platforms such as android. for this reason this sample proposes a structured template for the ease of porting across all available platforms. all the platform specific code should reside in the project file (.lpr) and the portable code should be move into separate modules (g2app.pas in case of this examle). this way the template needs to be setup only once and only the portable code will be changed for all the further projects.

compiling for windows, linux and mac os is very simple all you need is the operating system and lazarus installed. however, the setup for android is a bit more complex than that. to assemble an apk file you will need to install eclipse with the android sdk plugin. if you have a linux there is a very easy way to setup the entire environment including an fpc 2.6.0 compiler. download http://gen2gdk.com/files/ArmLinuxUtils.tar (~120mb) extract the contents and follow the instructions inside (it has only been tested on ubuntu). this way may take several hours to install all the ecessary components but it is very easy since all that you will need to do is run a script and follow some simple instructions.

this has been deprecated, the toolkit will be handling the non-standard cross platform builds
